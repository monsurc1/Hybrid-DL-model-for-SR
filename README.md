# Hybrid-DL-model-for-SR
**MSc Thesis/dissertation:** A Hybrid Deep Learning Model to Enhance Super Resolution. 

_Abstract_:
Advances in super-resolution (SR) and object detection have often been used largely in parallel within the domain of computer vision. While Enhanced Deformable Video Restoration (EDVR) by Wang et al. [8] excels in generating high-resolution images, models like YOLOv8 (Ultralytics, 2023) are optimized for detecting and segmenting objects within those images. This research seeks to synergize these specialized capabilities into a unified framework while adopting a ‘qualitative methodology’ approach. Utilising a PyTorch-based implementation, the study fuses the aligned feature maps produced by EDVR with YOLOv8-seg's contextual layers on a standard Set5 dataset. The hypothesis posits that the fusion of features from both models will result in high-quality superresolution outputs, augmented with precise object detection and segmentation. The proposed model has applications across various domains, including surveillance, medical imaging, and
autonomous vehicles.
